### Overview of this Task

We were asked to create a program that would manage a user database and the various tasks that were assigned to each user. Numerous functions were required to be coded to ensure the various aspects of the task manager was working correctly.

### Key Functions of the Task Manager

* Producing 2 separate menus for Admin user and normal user
* Viewing all the tasks currently on the database
* Being able to edit any aspect of a specific task for a user (changing task status, deadline date, etc.)
* Working with and editing text files
* Reading information from the text files

As a new student to Python, I found this to be an extremely challenging task. There were numerous new aspects and functions that were introduced to me in a short space of time, but I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge.
